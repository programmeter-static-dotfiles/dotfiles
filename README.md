# i3wm dotfiles
These are my dotfiles for i3wm, on my Debian installation. There are 2 themes - a blue theme and a yellow/orange theme. **The `install.sh` file is only meant for my personal use. It installs programs I use that you probably do not need. Do not run it.**

## Installation
To install this theme, paste the configs of the programs I use to the location of your configs on the system. For example, for the `i3/config` file, paste it into `~/.config/i3/`. 

**[!] For files that could be used to compromise system security, such as vpn.sh, grub config file and lightdm.conf - remember to change file ownership to root and remove write permissions**
